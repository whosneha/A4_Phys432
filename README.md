Please Note I collaborated with Patrick Horlaville and Jasmine Zhang
For Question 2.2, here is the resulting plot to evaluate the width when varying the time. When we change the dt from 0.01 to 0.001 the result is that the width is much larger. <img width="614" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-24 at 11 21 11 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59903064/160047865-3ca5b118-aab4-4f2e-ab32-20a292b89041.png">

This is the relationship that we expect. 
When shifting the dx value from 2.0 to 10.0 the width is much narrower. Here is the result. Run code to retrieve the same results.
